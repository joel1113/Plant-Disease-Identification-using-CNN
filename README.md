🌿 Plant Disease Detection using Keras
This repository contains code for building a plant disease detection model using TensorFlow’s Keras API. The model is trained to identify various plant diseases from images of leaves using deep learning techniques. The implementation is based on a Kaggle notebook that uses the PlantVillage dataset for image classification

Project Overview
Plants can suffer from a wide range of diseases that affect crop yield and quality. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify leaf images into healthy vs diseased categories. The model learns visual features from labeled training images and predicts disease labels for new input images.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from PlantVillage, a publicly available plant disease dataset consisting of thousands of labeled leaf images across multiple plant species and disease types. You need to download this dataset separately from Kaggle and place it in your data/ folder to train the model.

Features
Trains a CNN deep learning model for image classification.
Uses Keras (TensorFlow backend) for model building and training.
Outputs plant disease predictions from leaf images.
